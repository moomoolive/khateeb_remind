# Khateeb Remind

## بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

Khateeb Remind: An app to organize jummah khateeb communication - once and for all.

You can start using the app by visiting this [website](https://app.khateebs.com) and creating an institution. Khateeb Remind intends to stay free forever insha'Allah and the app does not share any of your data with 3rd parties.

If you're not satisified with the official app please leave an issue under the 'issues' tab for this repository - Jazakum Allah Khair.

As Khateeb Remind is an open-source project feel free to pull this project, make the changes you want, and host it independantly - with or without attributing credit.
