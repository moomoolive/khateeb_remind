Khateeb Remind was orignially designed to be used at the University of Calgary MSA to help those who schedule khateebs for jummah to easily make sense of the tens of volunteer khateebs' schedules' in the UofC jummah rotation. Whether that's which khateeb can give certain khutbahs, which khateebs are unavailable on certain days, and generally keep track of khutbah history.

If you have any suggestions to improve the app or find bugs please open a pull request or file an issue.

This app intends to stay open-source and free forever, insha'Allah.

As the project is open-sourced, you're free to make your own instance of the app and host it wherever you want. If you intend to do so please read *ALL* the readme files in the 'code' folder. It may also be useful to take a look at the [design document](https://github.com/moomoolive/khateeb_remind/blob/master/systemDesign/README.md) found under the 'systemDesign' folder. You'll find all the needed configurations and environmental variables for the client-side code in the "App.config.js" file at the root of the project and in "Server.config.js" for the server-side code.

May Allah make this a long-lasting and beneficial project. Ameen.
