# Library Conventions

* "Main" - these files are the public interface a given library and functions therein are meant to be used outside of the library
* "Helpers" - these files are the implementation details of the public interface and are not meant to be used outside of the library

Tests for public interfaces are found in the same folder as the "main" file
